# Sol Quizz

Sol quizz is a fun cli interface to test your solidity knowledge.

## How to use it ?
1) Clone the project
2) `npm run data`
3) `npm run play`

You can choose between basic and advanced knowledge.

The advanced knowledge is 100% based on the question / answer from (Secureum Races)[https://github.com/secureum/RACE].


NB:

This is still WIP, if you experience  bug or want improvements, feel free to open an issue.

What's next ?

I'll keep adding more question and create a dedicated section for security later on
